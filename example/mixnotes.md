# Notes on Mix

Mix is the elixir CLI tool.

## Project

- This project was generated with `mix new example`
- a `.exs` file is a script file that will not be compiled
  - Usually used for configs, or other utilities such as scripts to populate DBs.
  - By default `.formatter.exs` and `mix.exs` are made.

### formatter: `.formatter.exs`  

- This is used by `mix format` to format the project files

### Dependencies: `mix.exs`

- Basically a project.json file.
- can also be used for [alias](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html#module-aliases)'
  
### Built in Tester: ExUnit

- `mix test` will run tests in the test folder. By default, example tests are generated.
